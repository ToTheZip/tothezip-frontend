# Image Assets

For the SignupPage component to work properly, you need to add the following images to the `public/images/` directory:

## Required Images:

1. **login_dozip.png** - The character illustration (dozip character peeking from above)
2. **tothezip_logo.png** - The "ToTheZip" text logo

You can download these images from the Figma design:

- Figma URL: https://www.figma.com/design/hAfJBw0KjuKrUmmR30cwEy/tothezip?node-id=133-2861&m=dev

## Alternative:

If you don't have access to the original image assets, you can:

1. Use the localhost URLs provided in the Figma export (temporary)
2. Export the images directly from Figma
3. Create placeholder images with the correct dimensions

### Image Dimensions:

- login_dozip.png: 304px × 150px (approximate)
- tothezip_logo.png: 194px × 62px (approximate)
